# The application works in two ways. When you run the application in cmd window, if you press the Enter key without entering any parameters, it will dynamically sort the files in the "template" directory by numbering them. At this stage, it asks you to choose a file number. After entering the file number you want to select and pressing Enter, it is waiting for you to enter the new name of the file you want to copy. The point to note here is that you need to enter the extension of the file along with the file name. For example, you should not enter the new name of the file "date_fix.sh" as "new_name_date_fix" without an extension.
# For the second case (where the parameter will be entered), you must enter the file name (with its extension) that you want to copy directly without pressing the Enter key at the beginning, then the new name (with its extension) of the file you want to copy, leaving a one-character space. In both cases, copies of the files with their new names will eventually be created in the "output" directory.
